              The q/acc protocol provides a community-first, fair launch for
              projects ready to tokenize and share their value creation with
              their community of supporters. We believe in a future where
              community-owned protocols are abundant and mainstream.

              If you‚Äôve been invited by a project to their early access period,

              üìÖ Early Access Mint Rounds
            </h1>
            <p>
              To invite you to their early access window, the project team mints
              a special NFT to your address. That NFT grants you access to
              participate in the early access mint rounds for their project.
              After each round, the value of the project‚Äôs token increases based
              on how many new tokens were minted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making this a fair launch! Individual caps allow more people to
              participate in the important early stage of a project‚Äôs token
              economy. Limits for the total amount raised during this period
              ensures that q/acc round supporters will also have a fair deal.
              Once the per-round limit is reached, the round is closed. When the
              limit is reached in the last round, the early access window is
              closed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The per-person cap and per-round limit for each of the early
              access mint rounds are in POL. They are calculated at the start of
              the round based on what the following USD-equiv of POL is at that
              time:

            <p>
              You will be asked to complete a zero knowledge KYC before you
              support a project during the mint rounds. This step mitigates
              Sybil attacks and prevents prohibited actors from participating.
              It is fast and easy: find the step-by-step instructions on how to
