              Welcome to q/acc Season 1
            </h1>
            <p>
              The q/acc protocol provides a community-first, fair launch for
              projects ready to tokenize and share their value creation with
              their community of supporters. We believe in a future where
              community-owned protocols are abundant and mainstream.

              If you‚Äôve been invited by a project to their early access period,
              you‚Äôre in the right place.
              <br />

                üìÖ Early Access Mint Rounds
              </h1>
              <p>
                To invite you to their early access window, the project team
                mints a special NFT to your address. That NFT grants you access
                to participate in the early access mint rounds for their
                project. After each round, the value of the project‚Äôs token
                increases based on how many new tokens were minted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making this a fair launch! Individual caps allow more people to
                participate in the important early stage of a project‚Äôs token
                economy. Limits for the total amount raised during this period
                ensures that q/acc round supporters will also have a fair deal.
                Once the per-round limit is reached, the round is closed. When
                the limit is reached in the last round, the early access window
                is closed.
              </p>

                The per person, per project cap and per-round limit for each of
                the early access mint rounds are in POL. They are calculated at
                the start of the round based on what the following USD-equiv of
                POL is at that time:

              </h1>
              <p>
                The q/acc round runs for 2 weeks. During this time, you may
                provide support for any or all of the q/acc projects. At the end
                of the round, you will receive project tokens as a thank-you for
                your early support.¬†
              </p>
              <p>
                During q/acc rounds, your support acts as a signal that
                allocates a matching pool across all q/acc projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure a fair distribution to the wider community, each
                address can send a project up to a certain cap amount,
                preventing anyone from acquiring too many tokens than others.
                Once the q/acc round has collected a specific threshold amount
                from all supporters, your cap decreases as the total amount
                received in the q/acc round increases.¬† You will see the max
                amount you may send to reach that cap on the project‚Äôs page. At
                any time, you may view your token holdings, see the unlock
                schedule and claim these tokens right here on Giveth by logging
                into your q/acc profile.
