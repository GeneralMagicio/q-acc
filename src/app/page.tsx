                  the total amount raised during this period ensures that q/acc
                  round supporters will also have a fair deal. Once the

                  The per-person, per-project cap and per-round limit for each

                  Once the per-round limit has reached 90%, the per-person

                  The current approach to token launches often sidelines the
                  community, leaving you out of the action. With the q/acc
                  protocol, that changes. Now, you can participate at the very
                  earliest stage of a web3 startup‚Äôs token economy, gaining a
                  stake in these projects‚Äô success and direct access to their
                  teams.¬†

                <p>
                  It‚Äôs a win for you, a win for web3 builders, and a boost for
                  the Polygon zkEVM ecosystem.

                  The q/acc round is open for only two weeks, giving you the
                  chance to support these projects at the very start of their
                  token economies. At the end of the round, you receive tokens
                  for the projects you have supported.

                <p className='mb-10'>
                  Additionally, your support provides a signal for the Quadratic
                  Funding (QF) allocation of a Matching Pool. The funds from
                  this pool are then used to provision liquidity for these
                  projects on our partner DEX, QuickSwap. After the q/acc round
                  ends, anyone can acquire the project‚Äôs tokens on QuickSwap.

                  * If you are from an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) listed
                  country or from the US or UK, you will not be able to
                  participate in the q/acc round. Zero-knowledge ID (zkID) is
                  used to comply with AML, and to restrict the US and UK for
                  regulatory reasons. It also mitigates Sybil attacks during the
                  q/acc rounds, ensuring a fair launch, as well as protecting
                  the projects and their supporters. When you create your q/acc
                  account, you will be prompted to complete zkID with our
                  identity partner, Privado.
