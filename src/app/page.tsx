                Your early-access NFT grants you access to participate in the
                project‚Äôs early access mint rounds. After each round, new tokens
                are issued and distributed by the bonding curve, and the value
                of that project‚Äôs token changes based on how many new tokens
                were minted.

                important early stage of a project‚Äôs token economy. Limits for
                the total amount raised during this period ensures that q/acc
                round supporters will also have a fair deal. Once the per-round
                limit is reached, the round is closed. When the round limit is

                All supporters are required to complete KYC with PrivadoID
                before participating. The q/acc protocol uses zero knowledge ID
                to comply with AML guidelines, ensure age requirements are met,
                and restrict participation from USA and UK citizens for
                regulatory reasons. This measure both protects project teams and
                mitigates Sybil attacks during q/acc rounds. If you already have
                credentials with PrivadoID, they should work here. If not, it‚Äôs
