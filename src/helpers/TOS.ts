  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>You understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed.</li>
    <li>You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Polygon are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.</li>
    <li>You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Technology.</li>
    <li>You understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Technology.</li>
    <li>You understand that we do not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed.
